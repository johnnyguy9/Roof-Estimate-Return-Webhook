**Key change:** Remove any `outputDirectory` or `buildCommand` settings. For API-only projects, Vercel doesn't need an output directory.

## 🎯 OR: Even Simpler - Delete vercel.json

If the above doesn't work, you can actually **delete `vercel.json` entirely**. Vercel will auto-detect your API routes and work fine without it.

1. Go to your repo
2. Click `vercel.json`
3. Click the trash icon (Delete file)
4. Commit the deletion

Vercel will auto-redeploy and should work!

## ✅ Expected Result

After the fix, you should see:
```
✓ Building...
✓ Serverless Function compiled: api/estimate-callback.ts
✓ Ready! Deployed to production.
